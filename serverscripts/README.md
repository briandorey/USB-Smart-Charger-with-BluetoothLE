# USB Smart Charger with Bluetooth LE Server Scripts

This folder contains the script run on the Raspberry Pi to obtain the charging data and upload it to a remote host.

The createdbtable.txt file contains a sql script to create the required database table (MS SQL Server Express used) and the charger.aspx file processes the received data and saves it into the database.

Not all of the USB chargers data fields are being used in this code.
