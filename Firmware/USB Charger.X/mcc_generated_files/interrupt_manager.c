  @Summary:
    This is the generated driver implementation file for setting up the
    interrupts using MPLAB® Code Configurator

  @Description:
    This source file provides implementations for MPLAB® Code Configurator interrupts.
    Generation Information : 
        Product Revision  :  MPLAB® Code Configurator - v2.10
        Device            :  PIC24FJ128GC006
        Version           :  1.01
    The generated drivers are tested against the following:
        Compiler          :  XC16 v1.23
        MPLAB             :  MPLAB X 2.26
